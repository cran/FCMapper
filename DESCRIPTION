    www.fcmappers.net/joomla/>, developed by Michael Bachhofer and Martin Wildenberg.
    Maps are inputted as adjacency matrices. Attributes of the maps and the
    equilibrium values of the concepts (including with user-defined constrained
    values) can be calculated. The maps can be graphed with a function that calls
    'igraph'. Multiple maps with shared concepts can be aggregated.
